# Auto Bow Mod for Minecraft 1.21 Fabric

## üéØ Key Features

### Three Smart Operating Modes
- **üïí Simple Mode**: Pure timed cycles (shoot X minutes, break Y minutes) - no interruptions, no daily limits
- **üìä Efficiency Mode**: Automatic breaks when XP rates drop below your threshold (default: 60%)
- **üß† Learning Mode**: Server-adaptive optimization with pattern learning and automatic timing adjustments

### Real McMMO Integration
- **Detects bossbar progress format**: `[current / total xp]` - works with all McMMO configurations
- **Real-time XP rate monitoring** with 100k XP/min baseline (GOOD performance)
- **Automatic efficiency tracking** and diminishing returns detection
- **Performance ratings**: EXCELLENT (150k+), GOOD (100k+), FAIR (80k+), BELOW AVERAGE, POOR

### Professional GUI & HUD
- **Tabbed settings interface** with 6 organized sections (Timing, Movement, Simple Mode, Efficiency, Learning, HUD)
- **Customizable HUD** with 4 corner positioning options and scaling (50%-150%)
- **Mode-aware display** showing relevant information per operating mode
- **Real-time efficiency monitoring** with visual progress bars

### Advanced Automation Features
- **Network packet-based bow automation** for Minecraft 1.21 Fabric
- **Advanced randomization** with pattern detection avoidance
- **Movement variation control** (completely optional - OFF stays OFF)
- **Durability protection** with configurable thresholds
- **Multi-hand bow support** (main hand and offhand detection)

### Server Adaptation
- **Learns optimal timing patterns** for each server automatically
- **Adapts to server response patterns** and anti-cheat systems
- **Comprehensive session statistics** and daily tracking
- **Daily session limits** with smart reset functionality

## üìà Efficiency-Based Session Management

Unlike simple timer-based mods, Auto Bow monitors your actual McMMO XP rates and automatically takes breaks when efficiency drops below your configured threshold. This ensures optimal XP farming while respecting server diminishing returns mechanics.

**Example**: If your XP rate drops from 120k/min to 60k/min (below 60% threshold), the mod automatically pauses for a configurable break period to restore full XP rates.

## üìä Perfect Performance Baseline

Based on extensive testing, the mod uses **100k XP/min as the "GOOD" baseline** for McMMO archery farming, with clear performance indicators to help you optimize your farming efficiency.

## üîí Safety Features

- **Durability protection** prevents bow breaking
- **Daily session limits** prevent excessive use (configurable)
- **Movement variation** is completely optional (many users prefer OFF)
- **Server adaptation warnings** prevent unwanted setting changes
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting

## üõ† Technical Details

### Compatibility
- **Client-side only**: Works on most multiplayer servers where automation is permitted
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **Performance optimized**: Minimal impact on game performance
- **Mod Menu integration**: Config button opens settings GUI

### Anti-Detection Features
- Gaussian distribution timing patterns
- Pattern breaking algorithms
- Bias drift for long-term variation
- Micro-randomization for authenticity
- Optional movement variation
